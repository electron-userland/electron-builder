# 32 bit + 64 bit

If you build both ia32 and xha arch, you in any case get one installer. Appropriate arch will be installed automatically.

# Custom NSIS script

Two options are available — [include](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#NsisOptions-include) and [script](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#NsisOptions-script). `script` allows you to provide completely different NSIS script. For most cases it is not required as you need only to customise some aspects, but still use well-tested and maintained default NSIS script. So, `include` is recommended.

Keep in mind — if you customize NSIS script, you should always state about it in the issue reports. And don't expect that your issue will be resolved.

1. Add file `build/installer.nsh`.
2. Define wanted macro to customise: `customHeader`, `customInit`, `customUnInit`, `customInstall`, `customUnInstall`. Example:
   ```nsis
    !macro customHeader
      !system "echo '' > ${BUILD_RESOURCES_DIR}/customHeader"
    !macroend
  
    !macro customInit
      !system "echo '' > ${BUILD_RESOURCES_DIR}/customInit"
    !macroend
  
    !macro customInstall
      !system "echo '' > ${BUILD_RESOURCES_DIR}/customInstall"
    !macroend
   ```

* `BUILD_RESOURCES_DIR` and `PROJECT_DIR` are defined.
* `build` is added as `addincludedir` (i.e. you don't need to use `BUILD_RESOURCES_DIR` to include files).
* File associations macro `registerFileAssociations` and `unregisterFileAssociations` are still defined.
* All other electron-builder specific flags (e.g. `ONE_CLICK`) are still defined.

# GUID vs Application Name

Windows requires to use registry keys (e.g. INSTALL/UNINSTALL info). Squirrel.Windows simply uses application name as key.
But it is not robust — Google can use key Google Chrome SxS, because it is a Google.

So, it is better to use [GUID](http://stackoverflow.com/a/246935/1910191).
You are not forced to explicitly specify it — name-based [UUID v5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_5_.28SHA-1_hash_.26_namespace.29) will be generated from your [appId](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#BuildMetadata-appId) or [name](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-name).
It means that you **should not change appId** once your application in use (or name if `appId` was not set). Application product name (title) or description can be safely changed.

You can explicitly set guid using option [nsis.guid](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#NsisOptions-guid), but it is not recommended — consider using [appId](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#BuildMetadata-appId).
