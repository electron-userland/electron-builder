## To setup a local dev environment

For local development, you can use [yalc](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc) in order to apply changes made to electron-builder for your other projects to leverage and test with.

Env setup from scratch (line by line for an easy copy-paste)
```
pnpm i yalc -g

git clone https://github.com/electron-builder/electron-builder.git

pushd ./electron-builder
pnpm compile
find packages/ -type d -maxdepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0 -L1 sh -c 'cd "$0" && yalc push'
popd
```

You must link yalc's local "packages" to your project via the one-liner below (run from your project folder)
```
yalc link app-builder-lib builder-util builder-util-runtime dmg-builder electron-builder electron-publish electron-builder-squirrel-windows electron-forge-maker-appimage electron-forge-maker-nsis electron-forge-maker-nsis-web electron-forge-maker-snap electron-updater
```

The magical script for whenever you make changes to electron-builder! Rebuilds electron-builder, and then patches the npm modules in your project (such as electron-quick-start).
Ready for copy-paste into terminal presuming electron-builder repo is at root level outside your project folder, otherwise adjust path as necessary.
```
pushd ../electron-builder
pnpm compile
find packages/ -type d -maxdepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0 -L1 sh -c 'cd "$0" && yalc push'
popd
```

## Pull Requests
To check that your contributions match the project coding style make sure `pnpm test` passes.

[pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org) is required because NPM is not reliable and Yarn 2 is not so good as PNPM.

To build project: `pnpm i && pnpm compile`

If you get strange compilation errors, try to remove all `node_modules` in the project (especially under `packages/*`).

### Git Commit Guidelines
We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), so we have very precise rules over how our git [commit messages can be formatted](https://gist.github.com/develar/273e2eb938792cf5f86451fbac2bcd51).

## Documentation

To avoid google indexing, documentation files located in the branch `docs`. To clone:

```shell script
git clone --single-branch -b docs git@github.com:electron-userland/electron-builder.git docs
```

Documentation files located in the `/docs`.

`/docs` is deployed to Netlify when `next` release is marked as `latest` and available for all users.

`pip3 install mkdocs-material mkdocs markdown-include pymdown-extensions pygments --upgrade`

You'll want to copy the `mkdocs.yml` file from the master branch and then: `mkdocs build`

## Debug Tests

Only IntelliJ Platform IDEs ([IntelliJ IDEA](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+2017.1+EAP), [WebStorm](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/WI/WebStorm+EAP)) support debug.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA or WebStorm â€” [ij-rc-producer](https://github.com/develar/ij-rc-producer) is used and you can run tests from an editor (just click on `Run` green gutter icon).

Or you can create Node.js run configuration manually:
* Ensure that `Before launch` contains `Compile TypeScript`.
* Set `Node interpreter` to NodeJS 8. NodeJS 8 is required to debug.
* Set `Application Parameters` to `-t "test name" relative-test-file-name` if you want to debug particular test. E.g.
  ```
  -t "extraResources - one-package" globTest.js
  ```
* Set `Environment Variables`:
  * Optionally, `TEST_APP_TMP_DIR` to some directory (e.g. `/tmp/electron-builder-test`) to inspect output if test uses temporary directory (only if `--match` is used). Specified directory will be used instead of random temporary directory and *cleared* on each run.

### Run Test using CLI
```sh
TEST_APP_TMP_DIR=/tmp/electron-builder-test ./node_modules/.bin/jest --env jest-environment-node-debug -t 'assisted' '/oneClickInstallerTest\.\w+$'
```

where `TEST_APP_TMP_DIR` is specified to easily inspect and use test build, `assisted` is the test name and `/oneClickInstallerTest\.\w+$` is the path to test file.

Do not forget to execute `pnpm compile` before run.
