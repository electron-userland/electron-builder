# electron-builder [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> Complete solution to build ready for distribution and "auto update" installers of your app for OS X, Windows and Linux.

```
$ npm install --save-dev electron-builder
```

* [Native application dependencies](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/) compilation (only if [two-package.json project structure](#two-packagejson-structure) used).
* [Auto Update](#auto-update) ready application packaging.
* [Code Signing](#code-signing) on a CI server or development machine.
* [Build version management](#build-version-management).
* [Publishing artifacts to GitHub Releases](./docs/deployment.md).

[electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager),
[appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) and
[windows-installer](https://github.com/electronjs/windows-installer) are used under the hood.

Real project example — [onshape-desktop-shell](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell).

# Two package.json structure

We strongly recommend to use **two** package.json files (it is not required, you can build project with any structure).

1. For development

  In the root of the project.
  Here you declare dependencies for your development environment and build scripts.

2. For your application

  In the `app` directory. *Only this directory is distributed with real application.*

Why the two package.json structure is ideal and how it solves a lot of issues
([#39](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/39),
[#182](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/182),
[#230](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/230))?

1. Native npm modules (those written in C, not JavaScript) need to be compiled, and here we have two different compilation targets for them. Those used in application need to be compiled against electron runtime, and all `devDependencies` need to be compiled against your locally installed node.js. Thanks to having two files this is trivial.
2. When you package the app for distribution there is no need to add up to size of the app with your `devDependencies`. Here those are always not included (because reside outside the `app` directory).

# Configuration

See [options](./docs/options.md), but consider to follow simple 4-step guide outlined below at first.

## In short
1. Ensure that required fields are specified in the development `package.json`:

   Standard `name`, `description`, `version` and `author`.

   Custom `build` field must be specified:
    ```json
    "build": {
      "app-bundle-id": "your.id",
      "app-category-type": "your.app.category.type",
      "iconUrl": "(windows only) A URL to an ICO file to use as the application icon, see details below"
    }
    ```
   This object will be used as a source of [electron-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager#packageropts-callback) options. You can specify any other options here.

2. Create directory `build` in the root of the project and put your `background.png` (OS X DMG background), `icon.icns` (OS X app icon) and `icon.ico` (Windows app icon).

   <a id="user-content-linuxIcon" class="anchor" href="#linuxIcon" aria-hidden="true"></a>Linux icon set will be generated automatically on the fly from the OS X `icns` file (or you can put them into the `build/icons` directory — filename must contains size (e.g. `32x32.png`)).

3. Add [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) to the development `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "postinstall": "install-app-deps",
      "pack": "build",
      "dist": "build"
    }
    ```
    And then you can run `npm run pack` or `npm run dist` (to package in a distributable format (e.g. DMG, windows installer, NuGet package)).
    Both scripts are the same because If script named `dist` or name has prefix `dist:`, flag `--dist` is implied.

4. Install [required system packages](./docs/multi-platform-build.md).

# Auto Update
`electron-builder` produces all required artifacts:

* `.dmg`: OS X installer, required for OS X user to initial install.
* `-mac.zip`: required for Squirrel.Mac.
* `.exe` and `-x64.exe`: Windows installer, required for Windows user to initial install. Please note — [your app must handle Squirrel.Windows events](https://github.com/electronjs/windows-installer#handling-squirrel-events). See [real example](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell/blob/master/src/WinSquirrelStartupEventHandler.ts).
* `.full-nupkg`: required for Squirrel.Windows.
* `-amd64.deb` and `-i386.deb`: Linux Debian package. Please note — by default the most effective [xz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz) compression format used.

You need to deploy somewhere releases/downloads server.
Consider to use [Nuts](https://github.com/GitbookIO/nuts) (GitHub as a backend to store assets) or [Electron Release Server](https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server).

In general, there is a possibility to setup it as a service for all (it is boring to setup own if cloud service is possible).
May be it will be soon (feel free to file an issue to track progress).
It is safe since you should sign your app in any case (so, even if server will be compromised, users will not be affected because OS X will just block unsigned/unidentified app).

# Code signing
OS X and Windows code singing is supported.
On a development machine set environment variable `CSC_NAME` to your identity (recommended). Or pass `--sign` parameter.
```
export CSC_NAME="Developer ID Application: Your Name (code)"
```

## Travis, AppVeyor and other CI servers
To sign app on build server:

1. [Export](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH31-SW7) certificate.
 [Strong password](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/54773) must be used. Consider to not use special characters (for bash) because “*values are not escaped when your builds are executed*”.
2. Upload `*.p12` file (e.g. on [Google Drive](http://www.syncwithtech.org/p/direct-download-link-generator.html)).
3. Set ([Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables) or [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt)) `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` environment variables:
```
travis encrypt "CSC_LINK='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=***'" --add
travis encrypt 'CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=beAwareAboutBashEscaping!!!' --add
```

# Build Version Management
`CFBundleVersion` (OS X) and `FileVersion` (Windows) will be set automatically to `version`.`build_number` on CI server (Travis, AppVeyor and CircleCI supported).

# CLI usage
Execute `node_modules/.bin/build --help` to get actual CLI usage guide.
In most cases you should not explicitly pass flags, so, we don't want to promote it here ([npm lifecycle](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#current-lifecycle-event) is supported and script name is taken in account).
Want more — please file issue.

# Programmatic usage
See `node_modules/electron-builder/out/electron-builder.d.ts`. [Typings](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Typings-for-npm-packages) is supported.
