# electron-builder [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
Complete solution to build ready for distribution and "auto update" installers of your app for OS X, Windows and Linux.

```sh
npm install electron-builder --save-dev
```

* [Native application dependencies](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/) compilation (only if [two-package.json project structure](#two-packagejson-structure) used).
* [Auto Update](#auto-update) ready application packaging.
* [Code Signing](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Code-Signing) on a CI server or development machine.
* [Build version management](#build-version-management).
* [Publishing artifacts to GitHub Releases](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Publishing-Artifacts).

[electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager),
[appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) and
[windows-installer](https://github.com/electron/windows-installer) are used under the hood.

Real project example — [onshape-desktop-shell](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell).

# Two package.json structure

We strongly recommend to use **two** package.json files (it is not required, you can build project with any structure).

1. For development

   In the root of the project.
  Here you declare dependencies for your development environment and build scripts.

2. For your application

   In the `app` directory. *Only this directory is distributed with real application.*

Why the two package.json structure is ideal and how it solves a lot of issues
([#39](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/39),
[#182](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/182),
[#230](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/230))?

1. Native npm modules (those written in C, not JavaScript) need to be compiled, and here we have two different compilation targets for them. Those used in application need to be compiled against electron runtime, and all `devDependencies` need to be compiled against your locally installed node.js. Thanks to having two files this is trivial.
2. When you package the app for distribution there is no need to add up to size of the app with your `devDependencies`. Here those are always not included (because reside outside the `app` directory).

# Configuration

See [options](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options), but consider to follow simple guide outlined below at first.

## In short
1. Specify standard fields in the application `package.json` — [name](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-name), `description`, `version` and [author](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors) (for Linux [homepage](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-homepage) and [license](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-license) are also required).

2. Specify [build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#build) field in the development `package.json`:
    ```json
    "build": {
      "app-bundle-id": "your.id",
      "app-category-type": "your.app.category.type",
      "iconUrl": "(windows only)"
    }
    ```
   See [options](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options). This object will be used as a source of [electron-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager#packageropts-callback) options. You can specify any other options here.

3. Create directory `build` in the root of the project and put your `background.png` (OS X DMG background), `icon.icns` (OS X app icon) and `icon.ico` (Windows app icon).

   <a id="user-content-linuxIcon" class="anchor" href="#linuxIcon" aria-hidden="true"></a>Linux icon set will be generated automatically on the fly from the OS X `icns` file (or you can put them into the `build/icons` directory — filename must contains size (e.g. `32x32.png`)).

4. Add [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) to the development `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "postinstall": "install-app-deps",
      "pack": "build",
      "dist": "build",
      "myDistributionCmd": "build --dist"
    }
    ```
    And then you can run `npm run pack` or `npm run dist` (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)).
    Both scripts are the same because If script named `dist` or name has prefix `dist:`, flag `--dist` is implied. And if you do not name your script `dist` or prefix it with `dist:` and you don't pass `--dist` flag you will spend 24 hours ripping your hair out because OH MY GOD IT WAS JUST THAT?!?!

5. Install [required system packages](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build).

Please note — packaged into an asar archive [by default](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#BuildMetadata-asar).

# Auto Update
`electron-builder` produces all required artifacts:

* `.dmg`: OS X installer, required for OS X user to initial install.
* `-mac.zip`: required for Squirrel.Mac.
* `.exe` and `-ia32.exe`: Windows installer, required for Windows user to initial install. Please note — [your app must handle Squirrel.Windows events](https://github.com/electronjs/windows-installer#handling-squirrel-events). See [real example](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell/blob/master/src/WinSquirrelStartupEventHandler.ts).
* `.full-nupkg`: required for Squirrel.Windows.
* `-amd64.deb` and `-i386.deb`: Linux Debian package. Please note — by default the most effective [xz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz) compression format used.

For auto updating to work, you must implement and configure Electron's [`autoUpdater`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/api/auto-updater/) module ([example](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell/blob/master/src/AppUpdater.ts)).
You also need to deploy your releases to a server.
Consider using [Nuts](https://github.com/GitbookIO/nuts) (GitHub as a backend to store assets) or [Electron Release Server](https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server).
See the [Publishing Artifacts](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Publishing-Artifacts) section of the [Wiki](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki) for information on configuring your CI environment for automatic deployment.

For windows consider only [distributing 64-bit versions](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/359#issuecomment-214851130).

# Build Version Management
`CFBundleVersion` (OS X) and `FileVersion` (Windows) will be set automatically to `version`.`build_number` on CI server (Travis, AppVeyor and CircleCI supported).

# CLI Usage
Execute `node_modules/.bin/build --help` to get actual CLI usage guide.
In most cases you should not explicitly pass flags, so, we don't want to promote it here ([npm lifecycle](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#current-lifecycle-event) is supported and script name is taken in account).
Want more — please file issue.

# Programmatic Usage
See `node_modules/electron-builder/out/electron-builder.d.ts`. [Typings](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Typings-for-npm-packages) is supported.
