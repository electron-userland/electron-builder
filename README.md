# electron-builder [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/electron-builder.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/electron-builder) [![donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=W6V79R2RGCCHL)
A complete solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron app for MacOS, Windows and Linux with "auto update" support out of the box.

* NPM packages management:
  * [Native application dependencies](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/) compilation (only if the [two-package.json project structure](#two-packagejson-structure) is used).
  * Development dependencies are never included. You don't need to ignore them explicitly.
* [Code Signing](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Code-Signing) on a CI server or development machine.
* [Auto Update](#auto-update) ready application packaging.
* [Build version management](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#build-version-management).
* Numerous target formats:
  * All platforms: `7z`, `zip`, `tar.xz`, `tar.lz`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`.
  * [MacOS](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#MacOptions-target): `dmg`, `mas`.
  * [Linux](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#LinuxBuildOptions-target): `AppImage`, `deb`, `rpm`, `freebsd`, `pacman`, `p5p`, `apk`.
  * [Windows](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#WinBuildOptions-target): NSIS, Squirrel.Windows.
* [Publishing artifacts to GitHub Releases](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Publishing-Artifacts).

[appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) are used under the hood.

_Note: `appdmg` (and the platform specific `7zip-bin-*` packages) are `optionalDependencies`, which may require manual install if you have npm configured to [not install optional deps by default](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#optional)._

Real project example — [onshape-desktop-shell](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell).

# Two package.json structure

We recommend to use two package.json files (it is not required, you can build your project with any structure).

1. For development (`./package.json`)

   The `package.json` resides in the root of your project. Here you declare the dependencies for your development environment and build scripts (`devDependencies`).

2. For your application (`./app/package.json`)

   The `package.json` resides in the `app` directory. Declare your application dependencies (`depencencies`) here. *Only this directory is distributed with the final, packaged application.*

Why?

1. Native npm modules (those written in C, not JavaScript) need to be compiled and here we have two different compilation targets for them. Those used within the application need to be compiled against the electron runtime and all `devDependencies` need to be compiled against your local node.js environment. Thanks to the two `package.json` structure, this is trivial (see [#39](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/39)).
2. No need to specify which [files](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#BuildMetadata-files) to include in the app (because development files reside outside the `app` directory).

Please see [Loading App Dependencies Manually](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Loading-App-Dependencies-Manually) and [#379](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/379#issuecomment-218503881).

# Configuration

See [options](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options) for a full reference but consider following the simple guide outlined below first.

For an app that will be shipped to production, you should sign your application. See [Where to buy code signing certificates](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Code-Signing#where-to-buy-code-signing-certificate).

## Quick setup guide

1. Specify the standard fields in the application `package.json` — [name](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-name), `description`, `version` and [author](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors) (for Linux [homepage](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-homepage) and [license](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#AppMetadata-license) are also required).

2. Specify the [build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#build) configuration in the development `package.json` as follows:
    ```json
    "build": {
      "appId": "your.id",
      "category": "your.app.category.type",
      "win": {
        "iconUrl": "(windows-only) https link to icon"
      }
    }
    ```
   See [options](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options). This object will be used as a source for the [electron-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager#packageropts-callback) options. You can specify any other options here.

3. Create a directory `build` in the root of the project and save a `background.png` (MacOS DMG background), `icon.icns` (MacOS app icon) and `icon.ico` (Windows app icon) into it.

   <a id="user-content-linuxIcon" class="anchor" href="#linuxIcon" aria-hidden="true"></a>The Linux icon set will be generated automatically based on the MacOS `icns` file (or you can put them into the `build/icons` directory if you want to specify them yourself. The filename must contain the size (e.g. `32x32.png`) of the icon).

4. Add the [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) key to the development `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "pack": "build --dir",
      "dist": "build"
    }
    ```
    Then you can run `npm run dist` (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)) or `npm run pack` (only generates the package directory without really packaging it. This is useful for testing purposes).

    If you use the two `package.json` files approach, you'll only have your `devDependencies` in your development `package.json` and your `dependencies` in your app `package.json`. To ensure your dependencies are always updated based on both files, simply add `"postinstall": "install-app-deps"` to your development `package.json`. This will basically automatically trigger an `npm install` within your app directory so you don't have to do this work everytime you install/update your dependencies.
	

5. If you have native addons of your own that are part of the application (not as a dependency), add `"nodeGypRebuild": true` to the `build` section of your development `package.json`.  
   :bulb: Don't [use](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/683#issuecomment-241214075) [`npm`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/#using-npm) (neither `.npmrc`) for configuring electron headers. Use [`node-gyp-rebuild`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/683#issuecomment-241488783) bin instead.

   
6. Installing the [required system packages](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build).

Please note that everything is packaged into an asar archive [by default](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#BuildMetadata-asar).

# Auto Update
`electron-builder` produces all required artifacts:

* `.dmg`: MacOS installer, required for the initial installation process on Mac OS X.
* `-mac.zip`: required for Squirrel.Mac.
* `.exe` and `-ia32.exe`: Windows installer, required for the initial installation process on Windows. Please note that [your app must handle Squirrel.Windows events](https://github.com/electronjs/windows-installer#handling-squirrel-events). See [real world example](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell/blob/master/src/WinSquirrelStartupEventHandler.ts).
* `.full-nupkg`: required for Squirrel.Windows.

To benefit from auto updates, you have to implement and configure Electron's [`autoUpdater`](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/api/auto-updater/) module ([example](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell/blob/master/src/AppUpdater.ts)).
You also need to deploy your releases to a server.
Consider using [Nuts](https://github.com/GitbookIO/nuts) (uses GitHub as a back end to store the assets), [Electron Release Server](https://github.com/ArekSredzki/electron-release-server) or [Squirrel Updates Server](https://github.com/Aluxian/squirrel-updates-server).
See the [Publishing Artifacts](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Publishing-Artifacts) section of the [Wiki](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki) for more information on how to configure your CI environment for automated deployments.

For Windows consider only [distributing 64-bit versions](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/359#issuecomment-214851130).
