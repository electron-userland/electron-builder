macOS code signing is supported. If the configuration values are provided correctly in your package.json, then signing should be automatically executed.

On a macOS development machine, a valid and appropriate identity from your keychain will be automatically used.

## How to Export Certificate on macOS

1. Open Keychain.
2. Select `login` keychain, and `My Certificates` category.
3. Select all required certificates (hint: use cmd-click to select several):
   * `Developer ID Application:` to sign app for macOS.
   * `3rd Party Mac Developer Installer:` and either `Apple Distribution` or `3rd Party Mac Developer Application:` to sign app for MAS (Mac App Store).
   * `Developer ID Application:` and `Developer ID Installer` to sign app and installer for distribution outside of the Mac App Store.
   * `Apple Development:` or `Mac Developer:` to sign development builds for testing Mac App Store submissions (`mas-dev` target). You also need a provisioning profile in the working directory that matches this certificate and the device being used for testing.

   Please note – you can select as many certificates as needed. No restrictions on electron-builder side.
   All selected certificates will be imported into temporary keychain on CI server.
4. Open context menu and `Export`.

## How to Disable Code Signing During the Build Process on macOS

To disable Code Signing when building for macOS leave all the above vars unset except for `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY` which needs to be set to `false`. This can be done by running `export CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`.

Another way — set `mac.identity` to `null`. You can pass aditional configuration using CLI as well: `-c.mac.identity=null`.
